##### Gradient-decent-Algorithm-in-python
Gradient Decent is an optimization technique and is widely used for optimzation of ML and AI networks.
The code used is to demonstrate GD performance on an ML module.
A logistic regression module is optimised for costs using GD algorithm. Model parameters such as slop is updated in each iteration to find the best.
